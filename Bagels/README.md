# Bagels - Number Guessing Game

**Bagels** is a simple 3-digit number guessing game.  
The player tries to guess a secret 3-digit number generated by the computer.  
After each guess, the game gives hints to guide the player:

- **Fermi** – Correct digit in the correct position  
- **Pico** – Correct digit but in the wrong position  
- **Bagel** – No correct digits  

This project is designed to demonstrate **production-ready Python code** with modular design, utility functions, constants, and unit tests.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python (variables, loops, functions, lists/dictionaries)  
- Python 3.8+ installed  
- Optional: familiarity with **pytest** for running unit tests

## How to Play

1. Navigate to the Bagels project folder:

        cd small-python-projects/Bagels

2. Run the game:

        python main.py

3. Enter your 3-digit guesses when prompted.  
4. Use the hints (**Fermi**, **Pico**, **Bagel**) to guide your next guess.  
5. Continue until you guess the correct number.

## Running Tests

Unit tests are included for the core logic:

        pip install pytest        # Install pytest if needed
        pytest tests/
